# rpiambulance.github.io<nolink>

**rpiambulance.github.io<nolink>** (more specifically, **rpia.dev<nolink>**) is the RPIA dev team's website. Meta, right?

We're using GitHub Pages, which allows for quick development with Jekyll, a Ruby package.

See us live at https://rpia.dev!

(and check back later for local deployment instructions)
